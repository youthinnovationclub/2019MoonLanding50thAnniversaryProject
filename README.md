# MoonLanding50thAnniversaryProject
It is the projects for 2019 Moonhack, and its goal is to celebrate the human first moon landing at 1969

July 16, 2019 will mark the 50th anniversary of the launch of the Apollo 11 mission. It was on July 20, 1969 that Neil Armstrong became the first person to step onto the moon's surface. Buzz Aldrin joined him on the lunar surface just 19 minutes later. Michael Collins flew the command module Columbia in lunar orbit while Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon's surface. I thought I would do my part by putting together this montage as a tribute to what happened 50 years ago.

"Houston, Tranquility base here. The Eagle has landed."

"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."

We, at Youth Coding & Innovation Club, participate and submit multiple projects this year.
